# Neural networks basics

3 things go into nearual networks:
    - input 
    - output
    - target

Mean squared error(MSE) is also called the loss
    - MSE = (output - target)**2

w = weight
b = bias
y = target

## sending more than one number through the network

Uses vectors to do this
    - outputs will also be vectors
    - therfore target has to be a vector too

    X is the input vector
    Yhat is the target
    Y is the output

    r = residual
        - difference between Yhat and Y

    r**2

    MSE = average of SSE = Loss

Transposing transposed rt multipled by r

- Sum of Squared Errors(SSE) = rt*r
